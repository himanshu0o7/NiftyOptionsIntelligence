# Trading Issues Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

### ❌ Original Problems:
1. **WebSocket Error**: WebSocket connection failed
2. **Function Error**: `calculate_current_capital_usage` not defined
3. **Paper Trading Issue**: Auto trade button starting paper trade instead of live trade
4. **Market Data Issue**: Live data not fetching, showing market close

### ✅ Fixed Solutions:

#### 1. **CapitalManager Function Fixed**
- **Problem**: Function called directly without class instance
- **Fix**: Now properly uses `CapitalManager().calculate_current_capital_usage()`
- **Result**: Telegram notifications will work without errors

#### 2. **Live Trading Configuration Fixed**
- **Problem**: System defaulting to paper trading
- **Fix**: Live trading enabled by default (`paper_trading = False`)
- **Result**: Auto trade button now executes LIVE trades with real money

#### 3. **Trading Mode Display Fixed**
- **Problem**: Confusing trading mode indicators
- **Fix**: Clear "🔥 LIVE TRADE" vs "✅ PAPER TRADE" messages
- **Result**: You'll see exactly which mode is active

#### 4. **Market Data Status Enhanced**
- **Problem**: Always showing market closed
- **Fix**: Proper market hours detection (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM)
- **Result**: Accurate live data status during market hours
