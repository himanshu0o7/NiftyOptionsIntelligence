# Options Trading System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive options trading system built with Python and Streamlit that provides real-time market data analysis, automated trading strategies, risk management, and portfolio monitoring capabilities. The system integrates with Angel One's SmartAPI for live market data and trade execution, supports both paper trading and live trading modes, and includes advanced technical analysis and Greeks calculations for options trading.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **UI Components**: Interactive charts using Plotly, real-time data displays, configuration forms
- **Pages Structure**:
  - Main trading dashboard with live charts and options chain
  - P&L analysis and performance tracking
  - Risk monitoring and alerts
  - Strategy configuration and backtesting
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state for maintaining user data and connections

### Backend Architecture

- **RiskCalculator**: VaR calculations, portfolio risk metrics, stress testing
- **Risk Controls**: Automated stop-loss, position sizing, exposure limits

### Technical Analysis (`indicators/`)
- **TechnicalIndicators**: RSI, EMA, VWAP, and other technical indicators
- **GreeksCalculator**: Black-Scholes options pricing and Greeks calculation
- **Market Analysis**: Support/resistance identification, trend analysis

### Data Management (`data/`, `symbols/`)
- **InstrumentManager**: Download and cache instrument master data
- **Symbol Mappings**: Pre-configured NIFTY and BANKNIFTY option symbols
- **Market Data**: Historical and real-time data processing

## Data Flow

1. **Market Data Ingestion**: WebSocket client receives live ticks → Database storage → Strategy analysis
2. **Signal Generation**: Strategies analyze market data → Generate buy/sell signals → Risk validation
3. **Order Execution**: Validated signals → Angel One API → Order placement → Position tracking
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Continuous position monitoring → Risk calculations → Alert generation
5. **P&L Tracking**: Real-time P&L updates → Performance metrics → Dashboard display
