def get_recommended_strike(current_price, direction, step=50):
    if direction == 'CE':
        return round(current_price / step) * step  # ATM CE
    elif direction == 'PE':
        return round(current_price / step) * step  # ATM PE
For CE Buy
if trend == 'strong_up':
    strike = ATM - 50   # 1 step ITM
elif trend == 'sideways_to_up':
    strike = ATM        # ATM

# For PE Buy
if trend == 'strong_down':
    strike = ATM + 50   # 1 step ITM
elif trend == 'breakdown_expected':
    strike = ATM

Filters by Greeks (Delta/IV) and OI

Bullish Market (for CE Buy)

Greek	Best Value / Range	Why It Matters

Delta	✅ +0.45 to +0.65	Higher delta = faster gain in premium as spot rises
Gamma	✅ High (0.04+)	Ensures delta changes rapidly — good for momentum
Theta	⚠️ Low (–0.5 to –1.5)	You lose less premium due to time decay
Vega	✅ Neutral to rising	Slight IV increase boosts premium
OI	✅ CE OI Decreasing / PE OI Increasing	Indicates call writers covering = bullish confirmation


✅ Ideal Option: ATM or 1-step ITM CE with delta ~0.5, gamma high, theta low

📉 2. Bearish Market (for PE Buy)

Greek	Best Value / Range	Why It Matters

Delta	✅ –0.45 to –0.65	More price movement in your favor as market falls
Gamma	✅ High	Helps increase Delta rapidly in momentum
Theta	⚠️ Low (–0.5 to –1.5)	Avoids rapid time decay in sideways phase
Vega	✅ Slightly rising	Falling markets increase IV → good for PE
OI	✅ PE OI decreasing / CE OI increasing	Sign of bearish trend strength


✅ Ideal Option: ATM or ITM PE with ~–0.5 delta, high gamma, IV rising

🤝 3. Range-Bound / Sideways Market

> You shouldn’t buy options in this phase unless breakout/breakdown is expected.



Greek	Best Value / Range	Why It Matters

Delta	⛔ ~0.3 or lower	Not suitable — premiums don’t move much
Gamma	❌ Low	Minimal delta change = flat premiums
Theta	❌ High decay (–2.0 or worse)	You’ll bleed premium in time decay
Vega	❌ Falling	No IV expansion to help premium
OI	✅ Both CE & PE OI Increasing	Option writers dominating – wait & watch


✅ Best Action: Avoid option buying. Better to:

Wait for breakout (then CE buy)

Wait for breakdown (then PE buy)

OR sell options if experienced (range play)
Market Trend	Delta	Gamma	Theta	Vega	Strategy

Bullish	+0.5 to +0.6	High	Low decay	Neutral↑	CE Buy
Bearish	–0.5 to –0.6	High	Low decay	IV rising	PE Buy
Sideways	±0.2 to ±0.3	Low	High decay	Falling	Wait / Sell
